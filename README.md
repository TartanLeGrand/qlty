## Qlty CLI: Universal linting, auto-formatting, maintainability, and security scanning

Qlty CLI is a multi-language code quality tool for linting, auto-formatting, maintainability, and security with support for 70+ static analysis tools for 40+ languages and technologies.

With Qlty CLI, polyglot team can take advantage of the best code quality static analysis with fast, consistent, and unified results through a single tool. Configuration is done through a simple `.qlty/qlty.toml` file in your repository, which can be auto-generated based on the languages you use.

The Qlty CLI is **completely free for all use**, including for commercial projects, with no limits on contributors.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

The fastest way to install Qlty CLI is using our installer scripts which install our native binaries:

```bash
# Install on MacOS or Linux
curl https://qlty.sh | bash 


# Install on Windows
powershell -c "iwr https://qlty.sh | iex"
```

We also package the CLI as a [Docker image](https://github.com/qltysh/qlty/pkgs/container/qlty) on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

> [!NOTE]
> The Qlty CLI does _not_ use Docker to run linters. By running linters natively, we achieve maximum performance. The Docker image is provided for situations where running the CLI as a containers is preferred over running it as a native binary.

### Setting up Qlty in a new repository

Setup Qlty within a Git repository:

```bash
cd my_repo/
qlty init
```

### Linting and auto-formatting

View a sample of lint issues:

```bash
qlty check --sample=5
```

Auto-format the codebase:

```bash
qlty fmt --all
```

### Maintainability and quality metrics
Scan for code smells like duplication:

```bash
qlty smells --all
```

Review a summary of code quality metrics:

```bash
qlty metrics --all --max-depth=2 --sort complexity --limit 10
```

### Configuration

Qlty CLI is configured using a `.qlty/qlty.toml` file in your Git repository. You can generate a default configuration with `qlty init` and then customize it.

Read our documentation about [configuration](https://docs.qlty.sh/analysis-configuration) for more information.

## üßπ Available Linters

Over 20,000 code quality rules are available via the Qlty CLI through its 60+ linter plugins.

To enable new plugins by adding them to your `.qlty/qlty.toml` file run:

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

Qlty CLI is available for MacOS, Linux, and Windows on x86 and ARM platforms.

### Additional requirements for PHP linters

Certain PHP linters require a working installation of PHP available in your `$PATH`. To install PHP, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or an alternative method.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Contributing

### Adding plugins

Creating a plugin can be as easy as writing a small plugin definition TOML file. If the tool has a custom output format (instead of a standard like [SARIF](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/)), then writing a simple output parser in Rust is also needed.

We also happily accept requests for new plugins via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/qltysh/qlty/issues/new/choose).

### Developing the CLI

Developing on Qlty CLI requires a working [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) and adheres to the standard Rust development process:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qltysh/qlty.git
cd qlty
cargo build
cargo test
```

### More information

More information about how to contribute can be found in CONTRIBUTING.md.

Reports of security vulnerabilities should be handled with the process outlined in SECURITY.md.
